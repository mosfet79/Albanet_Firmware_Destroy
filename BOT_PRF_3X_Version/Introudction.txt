The BOT system works with STM32WB55 32Bits microcontroller that uses four different buses:

	1.1) I2C Bus, running at 1Mhz.
	1.2) UART Bus, in mode async and 115Kbps.
	1.3) SPI with clock around 85 Mhz.
	1.4) USB bus in mode 2.0.


The systems includes BLE MESH Node that works like controller of light, considering the Light ON/OFF
and their Dimmer control like principal outputs. But the communication with the Provisioner of the
system is through another sub-system that communicates in mode wireless with MESH protocol encrypted.


The inputs of BOT systems are:

	A.1) SW1 (Switch 1), dedicated to activated the provisioner action for MESH protocol; this 
             is allocated on Port A and Pin 10, in mode PullUp, considering and IRQ assigned to the
	     the PIN, looking the FALLING effect to act.

	A.2) PIR Input, dedicated to receive the Sensor Signal that acts 

	(THIS CONFIGURATION IS ON START UP) BEFORE THE UART CONFIGURATION.
